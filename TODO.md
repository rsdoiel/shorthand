## Someday maybe

+ need a RegisterOp function that takes a string and a function and stores the result in a function table
+ need an EvalString function that takes a function table, symbol table and input string and either writes a string to stdout, make a new assignment or emits an error message with line number


# Think about and ideas

+ make a decision about labels being immutable or not.
    + pros is it simplifies handling significantly, also makes playback easier (makes things functional)
    + cons if you're typing in the repl you're going to want to replace a label's content periodically as you explore and make mistakes
+ add line number ranges when including include files.
